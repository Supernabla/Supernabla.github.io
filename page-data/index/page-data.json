I was mainly focusing on particle physics and medical physics as well as scientific software development for large-scale physics simulations and data analysis. When I had to juggle with large C++ frameworks, like <a href=\"https://root.cern/\">ROOT</a> and <a href=\"https://geant4.web.cern.ch/\">Geant4</a>, I gradually discovered that I'm very passionate about software development at a professional level.</p>\n<p>Now, at Brainlab, I'm working in a team which develops an ecosystem of software for the planning and navigation of orthopedic and neurological spine surgeries. My responsibilities as a full-stack developer include the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.dicomstandard.org/\">DICOM</a>-based data I/O, MVC-like abstractions as well as GUI.</p>\n<p>I'm an avid modern C++ programmer and naturally interested in software architecture, large-scale software development processes and DevOps.</p>"},"projects":{"frontmatter":{"anchor":"Code Projects","header":"Code Projects","subheader":"The Open-Source"}},"projectItems":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"imageFileName":"projects/02-thumbnail.png","imageFileNameDetail":"projects/02-full.png","header":"GateTetMesh","subheader":"Physics, GATE, Geant4, C++","visitLinkText":"View Commits on GitHub","visitLinkHref":"https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/commits?author=Supernabla"},"html":"<p><a href=\"http://opengatecollaboration.org/\">GATE</a> is a Monte-Carlo simulation toolkit for medical physics applications based on <a href=\"https://geant4.web.cern.ch/\">Geant4</a> and implemented in C++.
