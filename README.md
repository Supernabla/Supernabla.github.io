# Supernabla.github.io

This is the source code branch of my personal homepage. It's based on the starter template [Gatsyby startbootstrap-agency](https://github.com/thundermiracle/gatsby-startbootstrap-agency)'s and built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based static site generator.

## Third-party assets

Apart from the React and Gatsby ecosystems, it makes use of other external softwares, libraries and artworks:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
* [React Scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll)
* [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
