GATE is a Monte-Carlo simulation toolkit for medical physics applications based on Geant4 and implemented in C++. As part of my Master's thesis 'Triangular- and Tetrahedral-Mesh Virtual Patient Geometries in Radiotherapy Monte Carlo Simulations', I contributed a proof-of-concept implementation of tetrahedral-mesh geometries and a corresponding radiation dose scorer.
