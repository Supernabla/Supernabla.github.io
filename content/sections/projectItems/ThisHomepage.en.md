This is an entirely static homepage built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and hosted on GitHub pages. It's based on the Gatsby starter [startboostrap-agency](https://github.com/thundermiracle/gatsby-startbootstrap-agency), which I adapted to my needs. The modern responsive design is thanks to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The page's i18n-localized contents are separated by design and queried via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
