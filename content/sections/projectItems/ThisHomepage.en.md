This is an entirely static homepage built with Gatsby and hosted on GitHub pages. It's based on ThunderMiracle's Gatsby starter 'startboostrap-agency', which I adapted to my needs. The modern responsive design is thanks to React and Bootstrap. The page's i18n-localized contents are separated by design and queried via GraphQL.
