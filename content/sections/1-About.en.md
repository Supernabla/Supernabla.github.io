I'm a full-stack app developer for [Brainlab AG](https://www.brainlab.com/), a medical technology innovator based in Munich, Germany.

For my graduate studies (M.Sc.) I was mainly focusing on particle physics and medical physics as well as scientific software development for large-scale physics simulations and data analysis. When I had to juggle with large C++ frameworks, like [ROOT](https://root.cern/) and [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/), I gradually discovered that I'm very passionate about software development at a professional level.

Now, at Brainlab, I'm working in a team which develops an ecosystem of software for the planning and navigation of orthopedic and neurological spine surgeries. My responsibilities as a full-stack developer include the implementation of [DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/)-based data I/O, MVC-like abstractions as well as GUI.

I'm an avid modern C++ programmer and naturally interested in software architecture, large-scale software development processes and DevOps.
